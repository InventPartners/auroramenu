# auroramenu
By Invent Partners [http://inventpartners.com]

A simple jQuery concertina menu which maintains state between page requests using cookies.

## Demo
Check out the [demo](https://inventpartners.github.io/auroramenu/).

## Requirements
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is the only requirement for this plugin.

## Usage
Include the JavaScript and CSS files.

Markup your menus (plugin supports multiple menus) using unordered lists and give them a class of `auroramenu`.  This will create totally unstyled menus. To give your menus some style, give them an additional class of `auroramenu-default`. Feel free to play with the CSS to change the colours etc. 

View the source of the [demo page](https://inventpartners.github.io/auroramenu/) for further guidance on the markup etc.
